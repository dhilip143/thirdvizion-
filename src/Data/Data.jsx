    `“Can I see how this looks in real life?”
 That’s the #1 question real estate buyers ask. And it’s exactly what Virtual Reality (VR) now answers—without needing to set foot on site.
For one of our clients, we transformed their static listings into interactive 3D VR walkthroughs.
 Buyers could now explore every room, every angle—from their phones or VR headsets. No more second-guessing room sizes. No more missed appointments. Just clarity.
 • Compared to traditional photos or video calls, VR created
 • 3x higher engagement
 • 50% reduction in site visit
 • Happier, faster-closing clients

It’s more than a “cool feature.” It’s a smart selling tool.
 If you're in real estate, VR can give your listings an edge that sells.

We hear this a lot — and honestly, it’s outdated.
Sure, gaming and face filters made AR popular.
But today? AR is doing real work in real industries.

Here’s how:
𝗠𝗮𝗻𝘂𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴: Technicians now use AR headsets that show repair steps directly on machines.

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Engineers can see the entire building layout in 3D before they build.
Catch design issues early. Save time and money.

𝗘𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 & 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: No more boring PDF manuals. New employees learn through immersive, hands-on AR training. They remember more and learn faster.

At Thirdvizion Labs, we help businesses use AR in practical ways — no hype, just results.
